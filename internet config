And create this netplan config file for a static IPV4 address (works for me): /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml .
 # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
 # For more information, see netplan(5).
 network:
   version: 2
   renderer: networkd
   ethernets:
     ens3: #network_interface_name
       dhcp4: no
       dhcp6: no
       addresses: [192.168.0.97/24] #ip address/24
       gateway4: 192.168.0.1
       nameservers:
         addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4] #dnsserver
Make sure you use the correct network interface name ("ens3" in this example).
Make sure you use the correct DNS servers (nameservers->addresses) for your network environment.
Once this file has been created, run the following commands as root to test & activate the configuration:
 sudo netplan --debug generate
 sudo netplan apply
sudo reboot
